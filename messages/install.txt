This plugin lets you quick-jump between headings within your comments and optionally creates a table of contents within your document 


How to use it
-------------------------------

Simply start using "headings" within your comments to organise your code using the format below (nb. the title characters are able to be changed within the plugin settings) 

First level heading...
/* > Heading 1 */

Second level heading...
/* >> Heading 2 */

Third level heading...
/* >>> Heading 3 */


Running the plugin
-------------------------------

You can then run the plugin as per below

1. Via the command palette (Crtl+ Shift + P) find and run "Table of Comments: Show"

2. Adding a keystroke binding within your preferences (recommended)
   Open "Preferenes -> Key Bindings - User" from the main menu then paste

   { "keys": ["f1"], "command": "table_of_comments" }


Thank you!
