This plugin lets you organise and quick-jump between headings in your comments as well as optionally output a live table of contents too.

How to use it
-------------------------------

Simply start using headings within comments to organise your code using the format below.
By default titles are represented by ">" but each title prefix can be customised via the settings.

/*
* > Heading 1
*
* >> Heading 2
*
* >>> Heading 3
*/


Jumping between titles
-------------------------------

It is easiest to run the plugin via a keybinding so that you can open the quick-jump menu quickly whilst typing.

1. Add a keystroke binding within your preferences (recommended)
   Open "Preferenes -> Key Bindings - User" from the main menu then paste

   { "keys": ["f1"], "command": "table_of_comments" }
   
   (This example runs the plugin by pressing F1)
   
2. You can also run the plugin via the command palette (Crtl+ Shift + P). Simply find and execute "Table of Comments: Show"


Outputting a table of contents
-------------------------------

You can optionally output a maintained list of the headings within your document by placing "TOC" inside a comment anywhere within the document.

For example placing...

/* TOC */

...anywhere in your document will automatically it update to reflect the headings in your comments each time you run the plugin.

/*
* TOC
*
* Heading 1
*  - Heading 2
*  -- Heading 3
*/

(You can change the title for your table of contents within the plugin settings.  For example, you can change "TOC" to be "Within this document", then simply place that text within a comment in your document to have the table of content maintained with that title.)


Customising the plugin
-------------------------------

Copy "tableofcomments.sublime-settings" from the plugin directory to your "Packages/User" directory then tweak the settings for parsing titles or formatting the table of contents output.
