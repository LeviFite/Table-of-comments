This plugin lets you organise and quick-jump between headings in your comments as well as optionally output a live table of contents.

How to use it
-------------------------------

Simply start using headings within comments to organise your code using the format below.
By default titles are represented by ">" but each title prefix can be customised via the settings.

/*
* > Heading 1
*
* >> Heading 2
*
* >>> Heading 3
*/


Jumping between headings
-------------------------------

The easiest way to run the plugin is via a keybinding so that you can open the quick-jump menu quickly whilst typing.

1. Add a keystroke binding within your preferences (recommended)
   Open "Preferenes -> Key Bindings - User" from the main menu then paste

   { "keys": ["f1"], "command": "table_of_comments" }
   
   (This example runs the plugin by pressing F1)
   
2. You can also run the plugin via the command palette (Crtl+ Shift + P). Simply find and execute "Table of Comments: Show"


Outputting a table of contents
-------------------------------

You can optionally output a maintained list of the headings within your document by placing "TOC" inside a comment anywhere within the document.

For example placing...

/* TOC */

...anywhere in your document will automatically update it to reflect the headings within your comments each time you run the plugin.

/*
* TOC
*
* Heading 1
*  - Heading 2
*  -- Heading 3
*/

(You can change the title for your table of contents within the plugin settings.  For example, you can change "TOC" to be "Within this document", then simply place that text within a comment in your document to have the table of content maintained with that heading.)


Customising the plugin
-------------------------------

You can tweak the plugin settings for parsing headings (ie. which characters designate each level of headings) as well as for formatting the table of contents output.

To view the existing plugin settings run the command "Table of comments: Settings - Default" from the command palette (Ctrl + Shift + P).
Then run "Table of comments: Settings - User" and paste in any of the settings you wish to change.

Ultimately the above creates a "tableofcomments.sublime-settings" file in your "Packages/User" directory.


Thank you!
