This plugin lets you organise and quick-jump between headings in your comments as
well as optionally output a live table of contents.

How to use it
===============================
Simply start using headings within comments to organise your code using the format below.
By default titles are represented by ">" but each title prefix can be customised via the settings.

```
/*
* > Heading 1
*/
...
/*
* >> Heading 2
*/
...
/*
* >>> Heading 3
*/
```

Now open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and search for the `Table of Comments: Show`
command and press enter.


Available commands:

    - Table of Comments: Show  -- Will show/generate the table of comments.
    - Table of Comments: Move Up  -- Move the cursor to the previous comment.
    - Table of Comments: Move Down  -- Move the cursor to the next comment.
    - Table of Comments: Settings - Default  -- Open the default settings file.
    - Table of Comments: Settings - User   -- Move the user settings file.


Setting keyboard shortcuts:

To run the show command when you press f1 you will have to open the
Preferences -> Key Bindings - User and insert a new key binding:

{ "keys": ["f1"], "command": "table_of_comments" }
